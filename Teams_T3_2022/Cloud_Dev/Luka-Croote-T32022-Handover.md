## Trimester Focus

The focus in trimester 3 was implementing a Machine learning pipeline using the best technology available. This work was begun to

1. Improve collaboration and R&D practices within the team
2. Improve build and deployment for the demo website

## Deliverables

<<<<<<< HEAD
The team delivered a program which could be run locally or on a remote vm which setup a Machine learning pipeline using `mlflow`. The program uses `mlflow` for model and experiment tracking server, `minio` for artifact storage and `sqlite` for metadata storage. The Demo runs on flask and uses a deployed endpoint from the `mlflow` model registry. [See here](insertlinkhere) for a guide on how to deploy the pipeline.
