# Breaking CAPTCHA Project

Project lead: Andrew Hallam (ahallam@deakin.edu.au)

## Project Description
This project is about using a combination of Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning(ML), and Deep Learning(DL) technique to create algorithms that crack different CAPTCHA system

Deliverables:
- AI/ML Models that can crack CAPTCHAs of different forms
- Documentation showcasing the development of the model (documentation should also track discontinued models, so that they are not re-attempted)
- Hand-over Documentation
- (Long Term) - a software that interacts with browsers to detect a CAPTCHA and and crack it.

## Team Structure
**Data Engineering/Data Scrappings:**

Lead: Hugh Wan (wanjunyuan@deakin.edu.au)
- Github Responsibilities (maintaining, approving merge requests, etc.)
- Data Responsibilities (obtaining, integrity, maintaining)
- Data Pipeline
- Real time website scraping

**Project Team A (Image based CAPTCHA)**

Lead: Cecilia Sammut (ccsammut@deakin.edu.au)
- Research (both CAPTCHA and Model research)

### Data Description
- [CAPTCHA breaking with Deep Learning](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi9-Jby1db2AhVU7HMBHamQCb0QFnoECAUQAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcs229.stanford.edu%2Fproj2017%2Ffinal-reports%2F5239112.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1COvEZdWx9HChGeN4bhUJh): This research paper mention that the have used *PyCaptcha*, which is a python package for CAPTCHA generation, to make custom CAPTCHA image dataset. It offers several degree of freedom such as font style, distortion and noise, so that people can exploit increase the diversity of the data and the difficulty of the recognition task.
