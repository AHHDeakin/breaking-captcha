# Breaking CAPTCHA Project

Project lead: Andrew Hallam (ahallam@deakin.edu.au)

## Project Description
This project is about using a combination of Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning(ML), and Deep Learning(DL) technique to create algorithms that crack different CAPTCHA system

Deliverables:
- AI/ML Models that can crack CAPTCHAs of different forms
- Documentation showcasing the development of the model (documentation should also track discontinued models, so that they are not re-attempted)
- Hand-over Documentation
- (Long Term) - a software that interacts with browsers to detect a CAPTCHA and and crack it.

## Team Structure
**Data Engineering/Data Scrapping:**
Lead: TBD
- Github Responsibilities (maintaining, approving merge requests, etc.)
- Data Responsibilities (obtaining, integrity, maintaining)
- Data Pipeline
- Real time website scraping

**Project Team A (Image based CAPTCHA)**
Lead: Cecilia Sammut (ccsammut@deakin.edu.au)
- Research (both CAPTCHA and Model research)
- Model development
- Model Review

**Project Team B (Text based CAPTCHA)**
Lead: William Tan Yoon Lok (tanyoonlok@deakin.edu.au)
- Research (both CAPTCHA and Model research)
- Model development
- Model Review
