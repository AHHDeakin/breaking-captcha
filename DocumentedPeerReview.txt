# Documented Peer Review

By Hugh Wan, Rayvinder, & Felipe

**Note that this document are only reviewing files that were included in the repository as of the time of this document were written.**

This document intend to review and comment on all of the codes and models that were commited/pushed to the GitHub repository. On top of that, I will also include some explanation on a certain models and the working logic behind it. The next part will divide into two section, which are for the text-captcha branch and the image-captcha branch, and subsequently the author and then the files. For example:

- BranchName
	- Author
		- Files
		

## <u>Text Captcha Branch</u>

### 1. Cecilia Sammut

#### <u>PreProcessing_Cecilia.py</u>

The code has a good documentation where every line of code has an explanation on what the author is doing. However, the author did not specify what is their desire outcome and possible next step in the future. I would suggest having another line of comment to explain what do they expect in this particular code. Writing explanation in a script file would be difficult, thus, having it in a jupyter files would be better.
